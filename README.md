# RPS-Multiplayer

<h1>Overview</h1>

In this assignment, you'll indeed create another Rock Paper Scissors game. The catch? You're going to make this an online multiplayer game, all with the help of Firebase (and the rest of your web development repertoire)!

## Motivation
My primary motivation beyond the assignment's due date is a genuine interest in learning how to work with firebase as well as learning how to structure code to focus on multiplayer aspects to serve as a solid foundation in my growth as a developer.
